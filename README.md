# Guidelines

This project aims towards beginners to simplify and practice contributing to projects. If this is your first contribution, follow the steps:

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open the terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project).

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd 1000-ways-to-print-hello-world-in-python
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

where "your-new-branch-name" should be of the format "using-_name of your implementation_"

For example:

```
git checkout -b using-print
```
## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now create a python file with the name "using-_name_of_your_implementation_.py" and make necessary changes.

__Note__: _Go through the existing code in the repository and if you find your strategy isn't there, you can implement the strategy in the file you just created._

For example if the method used is print, the python file name would be "using-print.py"

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "enter-your-commit-message-here"
```

For example:

```
git commit -m "add using print"
```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.
